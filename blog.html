                    forEach() and find() .</p>
                <p class="text-blue-400 text-lg py-3 px-10 text-left">The map() function transforms each element of the
                    original array according to the function supplied, and returns a new array with the same length as
                    the original array. The initial array is unaltered.<br> <br>

                    Filter() creates a new array with just
                    the elements that pass a specified condition (specified by a function). The initial array is
                    unaltered.<br> <br>

                    For each element in an array, the forEach() function runs the supplied function
                    once. It does not modify the initial array or return anything.<br> <br>

                    The value of the first element in an array that meets a testing function is returned by the find()
                    method. If no element
                    passes the test, it returns undef.</p>

                    storage and Cookies .</p>
                <p class="text-blue-400 text-lg py-3 px-10 text-left">LocalStorage: Information saved in LocalStorage is
                    permanent, meaning it is still accessible even after the browser or device is closed. A domain can
                    only access LocalStorage, which has a maximum size of 5 to 10MB. With every HTTP request, data kept
                    in LocalStorage is not transmitted to the server.<br> <br>

                    SessionStorage: Temporary information is
                    erased when the browser or tab is closed and is stored in SessionStorage. Similar in capacity to
                    LocalStorage, SessionStorage is only accessible by the domain that created it. SessionStorage data
                    is not transmitted to the server with every HTTP request, similar to LocalStorage.<br> <br>

                    Cookies: The server stores a few lines of text known as cookies on the user's device. They can be
                    used to store data like login credentials or user preferences and have a lifespan that is specified
                    by the server. Cookies can be accessed by both the client and the server and have a maximum size of
                    4KB. Each HTTP request includes a cookie, which can cause the request/response cycle to lag.</p>

                    program, gathering and analyzing events, and carrying out queued sub-tasks. <br> <br>The Call Stack
                    and the Callback Queue are two simple tasks performed by the Event Loop. The Event Loop will pull
                    the first event from the queue and put it to the Call Stack if it is empty, where it is effectively
                    run.</p>

                <p class="text-blue-400 text-lg py-3 px-10 text-left">The quizTimer function is in charge of controlling
                    a timer that counts down the amount of time left on the quiz, and it appears to be a component of
                    the quiz application. Dismiss is a boolean value that indicates whether to start or stop the timer
                    and is the only input the function accepts.</p>

                <p class="text-blue-400 text-lg py-3 px-10 text-left">The purpose of the chooseQuiz function is to store
                    the user's selected answer for a specific question in an array named answers. The function takes two
                    arguments - givenAns, which is the user's selected answer, and index, which is the position of the
                    question in the quizData array.</p>
